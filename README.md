# DmSiNet

This repository includes the code for the manuscript **"DmSiNet: Casting Thin Section Segmentation Method Based on Dense Multi-scale Feature Extraction and Spatial Information-guided Feature Fusion."**

The DmSiNET method is primarily designed for segmenting casting thin sections, particularly in the field of geological rocks. Below is an explanation of the code and its usage.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9 is recommended.

## Code Overview
1. **DenseBlock**: Acts as an encoder for DmSiNet, responsible for feature extraction.
2. **FeatureFusionModule**: Serves as a decoder for DmSiNet, used for feature fusion.

## Usage
- The `test_data` folder provides sample rock thin section data.
- Run the `predict` script for testing.

## Pre-trained Weights
- Pre-trained weight files are available for reference.
